# JS-CandyCrushSaga

## About the Project
This project is the famous Candy Crush game built using vanilla JavaScript. It is a playable game, but it is still in the early stages of development. The game is played on a 64-square board, with 8 rows and 8 columns. 

As a candy lover and someone who has known the Candy Crush game since its immense popularity, it was a surreal and super fun learning experience to actually build the whole game from scratch.

## Ideas for Future Updates
The project is still under development, and there are a number of features that I would like to add in the future. These features include:

- ```Special Candies``` : Include special candies with unique abilities. For example, striped candies that clear an entire row or column, wrapped candies that explode in a small area, and color bombs that clear all candies of a specific color.
- ```Add Bombs``` : Add a feature to spawn bombs across the board along with the candies. Bombs will act as score depreciators and need to be avoided strategically.
- ```Countdown timer``` : Add time-based levels where players must complete the objectives within a given time limit. This adds an element of urgency and excitement to the game.
- ```Leaderboard``` : Implement a leaderboard to track and display high scores. Allow players to compete against each other for the top spot.
- ```Animations and Visual Effects``` : Spice up the game with animations and visual effects for special moves, combos, and level completion.
- ```Tutorial and Tips``` :  Create an interactive tutorial to guide new players on how to play the game effectively. Provide in-game tips for players struggling on certain levels.
- ```Social Sharing``` : Allow players to share their achievements and high scores on social media platforms. This can help promote the game and attract more players.
- ```Different Game Modes``` : Include different game modes, such as a time trial mode, endless mode, or a mode with limited moves but no time constraint.
- ```Theme Customization``` :  Give players the ability to customize the game's appearance, such as choosing different backgrounds, candies, or themes.
- ```Fantastic Five or further``` :  This is a feature that rewards players for clearing five or more of the same candy in a row or column. Players can earn extra points or special power-ups for clearing a Fantastic Five.
- ```Multiplayer Mode``` : Implement a multiplayer mode where players can compete against their friends or other online players in real-time. Players can challenge each other to see who can get the highest score or clear the most levels.
- ```Daily Challenges``` : Introduce daily challenges with unique objectives and rewards. These challenges can be separate from the main progression levels.
- ```Bug fixes``` : No game is perfect, so it's always a good idea to fix any bugs that you find.

I'm always looking for ways to improve the game, so if you have any suggestions for new features, please feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vishalsingh2972/JS-CandyCrushSaga/issues) for review. I'd love to hear your ideas!
